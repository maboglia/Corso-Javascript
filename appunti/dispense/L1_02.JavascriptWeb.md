# The JavaScript Language - JS for Web

---

## What you need to know

* Client-Side JavaScript
  * JavaScript in web browsers
  * The window object
  * Scripting documents (DOM)
  * Scripting CSS
  * Handling events
  * Client-Side Storage
  * Scripted Media and Graphics
  * HTML5 APIs

## The Window object

* The Window object is the main entry point to all client- side JavaScript features and APIs
* It represents a web browser window or frame, and you can refer to it with the identifier “window”
* The Window object defines properties like location (URL currently displayed in the window) and methods like alert(), which displays a message in a dialog box or setTimeout(), which registers a function to be invoked after a specified amount of time
* The Window object is also the global object
* its properties and methods are global variables and global functions

```javascript
// Set the location property to navigate to a new web page
window.location = "http://www.google.it/";
// Wait 2 seconds and then say hello
setTimeout(function() { alert("hello world"); }, 2000);
```

---

## The Document object

* One of the most important properties of the Window object is document: it refers to a Document object that represents the content displayed in the window
* The Document object has important methods such as getElementById()
* It returns a single document element (representing an open/close pair of HTML tags and all of the content between them) based on the value of its id attribute

```javascript
// Find the element with id="timestamp"
let timestamp = document.getElementById("timestamp");
```

---

## The Document object

* The Element object returned by `getElementById()` has other important properties and methods that allow scripts to get its content, set the value of its attributes, and so on

```javascript
// If the element is empty, then insert the current date
// and time into it
if (timestamp.firstChild == null)
timestamp.appendChild(document.createText`Node`(new Date().toString()));
```

* Each Element object has style and className properties that allow scripts to specify CSS styles for a document element or to alter the CSS class names that apply to the element

```javascript
// Explicitly alter the presentation of the heading element
timestamp.style.backgroundColor = "yellow";
// Or just change the class and let the stylesheet specify the details
timestamp.className = "highlight";
```

---

## Event handler properties

* Important properties on Window, Document, and Element objects
* Allow scripts to specify functions that should be invoked asynchronously when certain events occur
* Allow JavaScript code to alter the behavior of windows, documents, and elements
* Event handler properties have names that begin with the word “on”

```javascript
// Update the content of the timestamp element when the user
// clicks on it
timestamp.onclick = function() {
this.innerHTML = new Date().toString();
}
```

---

## Example

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
/*CSS styles for this page*/
.reveal *{ display: none; } /* Children of class="reveal" are not shown */
.reveal*.handle { display: block;} /*Except for the class="handle" child*/
</style>
<script>
// Don't do anything until the entire document has loaded
window.onload = function() {
// Find all container elements with class "reveal"
let elements = document.getElementsByClassName("reveal");
for(let i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) { // For each one...
let elt = elements[i];
// Find the "handle" element with the container
let title = elt.getElementsByClassName["handle"](0);
// When that element is clicked, reveal the rest of the content
title.onclick = function() {
if (elt.className == "reveal") elt.className = "revealed";
else if (elt.className == "revealed") elt.className = "reveal";
}
}
};
</script>
</head>
```

---

## Example

```javascript
<body>
<div class="reveal">
<h1 class="handle">Click Here to Reveal Hidden Text</h1>
<p>This paragraph is hidden. It appears when you click on the title.</p>
</div>
</body>
</html>
```

* JavaScript program can traverse and manipulate document content through the Document object and the Element objects it contains
* It can alter the presentation of that content by scripting CSS styles and classes
* It can define the behavior of document elements by registering appropriate event handlers
* The combination of scriptable content, presentation, and behavior is called Dynamic HTML

---

## Embedding JavaScript in HTML

Client-side JavaScript code is embedded within HTML documents in four ways:

* Inline, between a pair of `<script>` and `</script>` tags
* From an external file specified by the src attribute of a `<script>` tag
* In an HTML event handler attribute, such as onclick or onmouseover
* In a URL that uses the special javascript: protocol.
* A programming philosophy known as unobtrusive JavaScript argues that content (HTML) and behavior (JavaScript code) should as much as possible be kept separate
* JavaScript is best embedded in HTML documents using `<script>` elements with src attributes

---

## Inline JavaScript code

* Between `<script>` and `</script>` tags
* Example: simple digital clock

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- This is an HTML5 file -->
<html> <!-- The root element -->
<head> <!-- Title, scripts & styles go here -->
<title>Digital Clock</title>
<script>
// A script of js code
// Define a function to display the current time
function displayTime() {
let elt = document.getElementById("clock"); // Find element with id="clock"
let now = new Date(); // Get current time
elt.innerHTML = now.toLocaleTimeString();
// Make elt display it
setTimeout(displayTime, 1000);
// Run again in 1 second
}
window.onload = displayTime;
// Start displaying the time when document loads.
</script>

```

---

## Inline JavaScript code

```css
<style>
    /*A CSS stylesheet for the clock*/
    /*Style apply to element with id="clock" */
# clock {
    /*Use a big bold font*/
    font: bold 24pt sans;
    /*On a light bluish-gray background */
    background: #ddf;
    /*Surround it with some space*/
    padding: 10px;
    /*Round the corners (where supported)*/
    border: solid black 2px;
    /*And a solid black border */
    border-radius: 10px;
}
</style>
```

```javascript

```

```javascript
</head>
<body> <!-- The body is the displayed parts of the doc. -->
<h1>Digital Clock</h1> <!-- Display a title -->
<span id="clock"></span> <!-- The time gets inserted here -->
</body>
</html>
```

---

## External JavaScript code

* Scripts can be placed in external files
* Useful when the same code is used in many different web pages
* Can be called in <head> or <body>
* JavaScript files: extension .js
* A JavaScript file contains pure JavaScript, without `<script>` tags or any other HTML

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## Event handlers in HTML

* JavaScript code in a script is executed once: when the HTML file that contains it is loaded into the web browser
* To be interactive, a JavaScript program must define event handlers
* JavaScript code can register an event handler by assigning a function to a property (such as “onclick” or “onmouseover”) of an Element object
* Typically an HTML event handler attribute consists of a simple assignment or a simple invocation of a function defined elsewhere

```javascript
<input type='button' value='Change color' id='theSubmit'
onclick="document.bgColor=changeColor()"/>
<input type='reset' value='White' id='theReset'
onclick="document.bgColor='white'"/>
```

---

## Basic interaction methods

* Alert dialog box
* OK to confirm
* Mostly used to give a warning message to the users

```javascript
<head>
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
alert("Warning Message");
//-->
</script>
</head>
```

---

## Basic interaction methods

* Confirmation dialog box
* OK, cancel
* True if user clicks on OK
* Mostly used to take user’s consent on any option

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
let retVal = confirm("Do you want to continue ?");
if( retVal == true ){
alert("User wants to continue!");
}else{
alert("User does not want to continue!");
}
</script>
```

---

## Basic interaction methods

* Prompt dialog box
* Returns a string with the text written by the user
* Returns null if user clicks on Cancel
* Used to get user input

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
let retVal = prompt("Enter your name : ",
"your name here");
alert("Hello " + retVal );
//-->
</script>
```

---

## JavaScript display possibilities

* JavaScript can “display” data in different ways

* Writing into an alert box: window.alert()
* Writing into the HTML output: document.write()
* Writing into an HTML element: innerHTML
* Writing into the browser console: console.log()
* <http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp>

---

## JavaScript display possibilities

* Using document.write() after an HTML document is fully loaded deletes all existing HTML
* document.write() is useful only for testing purposes

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Esempio</h1>
<p>Quanto fa 5 + 6 ?</p>
<button type="button"
onclick="document.write(5 + 6)">Prova</button>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## JavaScript display possibilities

* To access an HTML element, JavaScript can use the document.getElementById(id) method
* The id attribute defines the HTML element
* The innerHTML property defines the HTML content

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Esempio</h1>
<p>Quanto fa 5 + 6 ?</p>
<p id="demo"></p>
<button type="button"
onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML
= 5 + 6;">Prova</button>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## JavaScript display possibilities

* Example of innerHTML property

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>Esempio</h1>
<button type="button" onclick=
"document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">
Premi qui per sapere data e ora</button>
<p id="demo"></p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## JavaScript display possibilities

* In your browser, you can use the console.log() method to display data

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1>My First Web Page</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>
<p>
Activate debugging in your browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.
</p>
<script>
console.log(5 + 6);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## Scripting documents

* Client-side JavaScript exists to turn static HTML documents into interactive web applications
* Scripting the content of web pages is the central purpose of JavaScript
* Overview
* Basic architecture of the DOM
* How to query or select individual elements from a document
* How to traverse a document as a tree of `node`s: how to find the ancestors, siblings, and descendants of any document element
* How to query and set the attributes of document elements
* How to query, set, and modify the content of a document
* How to modify the structure of a document by creating, inserting, and deleting `node`s
* How to work with HTML forms

---

## Document Object Model (DOM)

* The Document Object Model, or DOM, is the fundamental API for representing and manipulating the content of HTML (and XML) documents
* HTML or XML document are represented in the DOM as a tree of objects

---

## Tree structure

* HTML documents are trees

## The DOM structure

* The entire document is a Document `node`
* If you want to access objects in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object
* Every HTML tag is an Element `node`
* The texts contained in the HTML elements are Text `node`s
* Every HTML attribute is an Attribute `node`
* Comments are Comment `node`s
* `Node`s have a hierarchical relationship to each other

---

## The `Node` object

* Hierarchy of the subclasses of `Node`

---

## Selecting document elements

* Most client-side JavaScript programs work by manipulating one or more document elements
* They must obtain or select the Element objects that refer to those document elements
* The DOM defines a number of ways to select elements: you can query a document for an element (or elements)

* with a specified id attribute
* with a specified name attribute
* with the specified tag name
* with the specified CSS class or classes
* matching the specified CSS selector

---

## Selecting elements by id

* Any HTML element can have an id attribute
* The value of this attribute must be unique within the document
* You can select an element based on this unique id with the `getElementById()` method of the Document object
* The simplest and most commonly used way to select elements

```javascript
let section1 = document.getElementById("section1");
/*
* This function expects any number of string arguments. It treats each
*argument as an element id and calls document.`getElementById()` for each.
*/
function getElements(/*ids...*/) {
let elements = {}; // Start with an empty map
for(let i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
// For each argument
let id = arguments[i];
// Argument is an element id
let elt = document.getElementById(id);
// Look up the Element
if (elt == null) // If not defined,
throw new Error("No element with id: " + id);
// throw an error
elements[id] = elt; // Map id to element
}
return elements; // Return id to element map
}
```

---

## Selecting elements by name

* The HTML name attribute was originally intended to assign names to form elements, and the value of this attribute is used when form data is submitted to a server
* Name assigns a name to an element, but unlike id the value of a name attribute does not have to be unique
* Common in the case of radio buttons and checkboxes in forms
* Unliked id, the name attribute is only valid on a handful of HTML elements, including forms, form elements, `<iframe>`, and `<img>` elements
* You can select an element based on its name attribute with the getElementsByName() method
* `let radiobuttons = document.getElementsByName("favorite_color");`

---

## Selecting elements by tag name

* You can select all HTML elements of a specified type (or tag name) using the `getElementsByTagName()` method
* Like `getElementsByName()`, `getElementsByTagName()` returns a `Node`List object
* The elements of the returned `Node`List are in document order
* `Node`list objects are read-only array-like objects
* They have length properties and can be indexed (for reading but not writing) like true arrays: you can iterate the contents of a `Node`List or HTML collections with a standard loop
* Properties like document.images and document.forms are **HTMLCollection** objects

```javascript
let spans = document.getElementsByTagName("span");
let firstpara = document.getElementsByTagName["p"](0);
let firstParaSpans = firstpara.getElementsByTagName("span");
for(let i = 0; i < document.images.length; i++) // Loop through all images
document.images[i].style.display = "none"; // ...and hide them.
```

---

## Selecting elements by CSS class

* The class attribute of an HTML element is a space- separated list of zero or more identifiers
* It describes a way to define sets of related document elements: any elements that have the same identifier in their class attribute are part of the same set
* JavaScript uses the className property to hold the value of the HTML class attribute
* You can select all HTML elements of a specified CSS class using the `getElementsByClassName()` method
* `getElementsByClassName()` returns a live **`Node`List**
* `getElementsByClassName()` takes a single string argument, but the string may specify multiple space-separated identifiers

```javascript
// Find all elements that have "warning" in their class attribute
let warnings = document.getElementsByClassName("warning");
// Find all descendants of the element named "log" that have the class
// "error" and the class "fatal"
let log = document.getElementById("log");
let fatal = log.getElementsByClassName("fatal error");
```

---

## Selecting elements with CSS Selectors

* CSS stylesheets have a very powerful syntax, known as selectors, for describing elements or sets of elements within a document
* The Document method `querySelectorAll()` takes a single string argument containing a CSS selector and returns a `Node`List that represents all elements in the document that match the selector
* The Document object also defines querySelector(), that returns only the first (in document order) matching element

```javascript
// Returns a list of all div elements within the document with a class
// of either "note" or "alert“
let matches = document.querySelectorAll("div.note, div.alert");
// Returns the first element <input> with the attribute name equal to
// "login" within a <div> of class="user-panel main"
let el = document.querySelector("div.user-panel.main input[name=login]");
```

---

## Document structure and traversal

* Once you have selected an Element from a Document, you sometimes need to find structurally related portions (parent, siblings, children) of the document
* A Document can be conceptualized as a tree of `Node` objects

---

## DOM and `node` relationships

* In a `node` tree, the top `node` is called the root (or root `node`)
* Every `node` has exactly one parent, except the root (which has no parent)
* A `node` can have a number of children
* **Siblings** (brothers or sisters) are `node`s with the same parent

---

## The `Node` object properties

---

## Navigation among `node`s

* `Node` properties useful to navigate between `node`s

* `parentNode`
* `childNodes[nodenumber]`
* `firstChild`
* `lastChild`
* `nextSibling`
* `previousSibling`

Other `node` properties

* `nodeName`
* `nodeValue`
* `nodeType`

<http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_navigation.asp>

---

## Document traversal

* Example

```javascript
<html>
<head>
<title>Test</title>
</head>
<body>
Hello World!
</body>
</html>
// The second child of the first child (it is the <body> element
document.childNodes[0].childNodes[1]
// The same
document.firstChild.firstChild.nextSibling
```

---

## Example

* Collects the `node` value of an `<h1>` element and copies it into a `<p>` element

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1 id="intro">My First Page</h1>
<p id="demo">Hello World!</p>
<script>
let myText = document.getElementById("intro").child`Node`s[0].`node`Value;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myText;
</script>
</body>
</html>
<script>
myText = document.getElementById("intro").firstChild.`node`Value;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = myText;
</script>
```

---

## HTML attributes as Element properties

* The HTMLElement objects that represent the elements of an HTML document define read/write properties that mirror the HTML attributes of the elements
* Note: HTML attributes are not case sensitive, but JavaScript property names are
* The Element type also defines getAttribute() and setAttribute() methods to query and set nonstandard HTML attributes

```javascript
let image = document.getElementById("myimage");
let imgurl = image.src;
// The src attribute is the URL of the image
let f = document.forms[0];
// First <form> in the document
f.action = "http://www.example.com/submit.php";
// Set URL to submit it to.
f.method = "POST";
// HTTP request type
let image = document.images[0];
let width = parseInt(image.getAttribute("WIDTH"));
image.setAttribute("class", "thumbnail");
```

---

## Element content

* Reading the innerHTML property of an Element returns the content of that element as a string of markup
* Setting this property on an element invokes the web browser’s parser and replaces the element’s current content with a parsed representation of the new string

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1 id="header">Old Header</h1>
<script>
let element = document.getElementById("header");
element.innerHTML = "New Header";
</script>
<p>"Old Header" was changed to "New Header"</p>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## Creating, inserting, and deleting nodes

* It is also possible to alter a document at the level of individual `node`s
* The Document type defines methods for creating Element and Text objects
* The `Node` type defines methods for inserting, deleting, and replacing `node`s in the tree

```javascript
// Asynchronously load and execute a script from a specified URL
function loadasync(url) {
// Find document <head>
let head = document.getElementsByTagName["head"](0);
// Create a <script> element
let s = document.createElement("script");
// Set its src attribute
s.src = url;
// Insert the <script> into head
head.appendChild(s);
}
```

---

## Creating `node`s

* To add a new element to the HTML DOM, you must create the element (element `node`) first, and then append it to an existing element
* The createElement() method of the Document object creates new Element `node`s
* The createText`Node`() method of the Document object creates new Text `node`s
* The createComment() method of the Document object creates new Comment `node`s

`let s = document.createElement("script");`
`let newnode = document.createTextNode("text node content");`

---

## Inserting `node`s

* Once you have a new `node`, you can insert it into the document with the `Node` methods appendChild() or insertBefore()
* appendChild() is invoked on the Element `node` that you want to insert into, and it inserts the specified `node` so that it becomes the lastChild of that `node`
* insertBefore() takes two arguments: the first argument is the `node` to be inserted; the second argument is the `node` before which that `node` is to be inserted. This method is invoked on the `node` that will be the parent of the new `node`
* If you pass null as that second argumentof insertBefore(), it behaves like appendChild()

```javascript
// Insert the child `node` into parent so that it becomes child `node` n
function insertAt(parent, child, n) {
if (n < 0 || n > parent.childNodes.length)
throw new Error("invalid index");
else if (n == parent.childNodes.length) parent.appendChild(child);
else parent.insertBefore(child, parent.childNodes[n]);
}
```

---

## Removing and replacing `node`s

* The removeChild() method removes a `node` from the document tree
* Invoke the method on the parent `node` and pass the child `node` that is to be removed as the method argument
* Example: remove the `node` n from the document n.parentNode.removeChild(n);
* n.parentNode.removeChild(n);
* The replaceChild() method removes one child `node` and replaces it with a new one
* Invoke this method on the parent `node`, passing the new `node` as the first argument and the `node` to be replaced as the second argument

---

## Replacing nodes

* Example

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<div id="div1">
<p id="p1">This is a paragraph.</p>
<p id="p2">This is another paragraph.</p>
</div>
<script>
let parent = document.getElementById("div1");
let child = document.getElementById("p1");
let para = document.createElement("p");
let `node` = document.createText`Node`("This is new.");
para.appendChild(`node`);
parent.replaceChild(para,child);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## HTML forms

* Tool to gather input from the user
* Server-side programs are based on form submissions
* They process data in form-sized chunks
* Client-side programs are event based
* They can respond to events on individual form elements
* E.g.: a client-side program might validate the user’s input as she types it, or it might respond to a click on a checkbox by enabling a set of options that are only meaningful when that box is checked

---

## HTML form elements and handlers

---

## Selecting forms and form elements

* Standard methods like `getElementById()` and `getElementsByTagName`, or querySelectorAll()
* Through the **HTMLCollection** document.forms
* Allows form elements to be selected by numerical order,
by id, or by name

```javascript
let fields = document.getElementById("address").getElementsByTagName("input");
// All radio buttons in the form with id "shipping"
document.querySelectorAll('#shipping input[type="radio"]');
// All radio buttons with name "method" in form with id "shipping"
document.querySelectorAll('#shipping input[type="radio"][name="method"]');
document.forms.address
// Explicit access to a form with name or id
document.forms[n]
// n is the form's numerical position
document.forms.address[0]
document.forms.address.street
document.address.street // only for name="address", not id="address"
```

---

## Form and element event handlers

* Examples

```javascript
// Ask the user to confirm the reset
<form... onreset="return confirm('Really erase ALL input and start over?')">
...
<button type="reset">Clear and Start Over</button>
</form>
Enter some text: <input type="text" name="txt" value="Hello"
onchange="myFunction(this.value)">
<script>
function myFunction(val) {
alert("The input value has changed. The new value is: " + val);
}
</script>

```

---

## Scripting CSS style

* Through the style property of the Element `node`
* style.property=new style
* Examples

```javascript
e.style.position = "absolute";
e.style.fontFamily = "sans-serif";
e.style.backgroundColor = "#ffffff";
e.style.left = "300px";
// Set the style attribute of e to the string s with either
// of these lines:
e.setAttribute("style", s);
e.style.cssText = s;
// Query the inline style string of the element e with
either of these:
s = e.getAttribute("style");
s = e.style.cssText;
```

---

## Handling events

* Client-side JavaScript programs use an asynchronous event-driven programming model
* Events are simply occurrences that a web browser will notify your program about
* Events are not JavaScript objects and have no manifestation in the source code of your program

* Event type
  * A string that specifies what kind of event occurred
  * E.g., the type “mousemove” means that the user moved the mouse, the type “load” means that a document (or some other resource) has finished loading from the network
* Event target
  * The object on which the event occurred or with which the event is associated
  * E.g., a load event on a Window, a click event on a `<button>` Element
* Event handler or event listener
  * A function that handles or responds to an event

---

## Handling events

* Event object
  * An object that is associated with a particular event and contains details about that event
  * Passed as an argument to the event handler function
  * Each event type defines a set of properties for its associated event object
  * E.g., the object associated with a mouse event includes the coordinates of the mouse pointer, the object associated with a keyboard event contains details about the key that was pressed
* Event propagation
  * The process by which the browser decides which objects to trigger event handlers on
  * For events that are specific to a single object (such as the load event on the Window object), no propagation is required
  * When certain kinds of events occur on document elements, however, they propagate or “bubble” up the document tree
  * Some events have default actions associated with them
  * E.g., when a click event occurs on a hyperlink, for example, the default action is for the browser to follow the link and load a new page
  * Event handlers can prevent default actions

---

## Handling events

* JavaScript code can be executed when an event occurs
* Simplest way: assign event attributes to HTML elements you can use (e.g onclick, onload, onchange, ...)
* event=JavaScript code
* Javascript code can be an expression or a function call
* Alternative: write event handlers
* `addEventListener()` method
* First advantage: you can add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e two "click" events.
* Second advantage: JavaScript is separated from the HTML markup for better readability
* Third advantage: allows you to add event listeners even when you do not control the HTML markup

---

## Handling events

* Example with JavaScript expression

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p id="p1">
The HTML DOM allows you to execute code when an event occurs.
</p>
<input type="button" value="Hide text"
onclick="document.getElementById('p1').style.visibility='hidden'">
<input type="button" value="Show text"
onclick="document.getElementById('p1').style.visibility='visible'">
</body>
</html>
```

---

## Handling events

* Example with function call

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<div onmousedown="mDown(this)" onmouseup="mUp(this)"
style="background-color:#D94A38;width:120px;height:20px;
padding:40px;color:white;font-family:Arial;font-weight:bold;">
Click Me</div>
<script>
function mDown(obj) {
obj.style.backgroundColor = "#1ec5e5";
obj.innerHTML = "Release Me";
}
function mUp(obj) {
obj.style.backgroundColor="#D94A38";
obj.innerHTML="Thank You";
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

## addEventListener()

* The `addEventListener()` method attaches an event handler to the specified element
* element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)
* The first parameter is the type of the event (like “click” or “mousedown”) * note: “click”, not “onclick”
* The second parameter is the function to be called when the event occurs
* The third parameter (optional) is a boolean value specifying whether to use event bubbling or event capturing
* You can add more than one event handler to the
same element

---

## addEventListener()

* Advantages
* The `addEventListener()` method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers
* You can add many event handlers of the same type to one element, i.e two “click” events
* You can add event listeners to any DOM object not only HTML elements, i.e the window object
* The `addEventListener()` method makes it easier to control how the event reacts to bubbling
* When using the `addEventListener()` method, the JavaScript is separated from the HTML markup, for better readability and allows you to add event listeners even when you do not control the HTML markup
* You can easily remove an event listener by using the removeEventListener() method

## addEventListener()

* Example: single event handler

```javascript
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p>This example uses the `addEventListener()` method to attach
a click event to a button.</p>
<button id="myBtn">Try it</button>
<script>
document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", function()
{
alert("Hello World!");
}
);
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## addEventListener()

* Example: multiple event handlers

```javascript
<p>This example uses the `addEventListener()` method to add many events on the same
button.</p>
<button id="myBtn">Try it</button>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
let x = document.getElementById("myBtn");
x.addEventListener("mouseover", myFunction);
x.addEventListener("click", mySecondFunction);
x.addEventListener("mouseout", myThirdFunction);
function myFunction() {
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Moused over!<br>"; }
function mySecondFunction() {
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Clicked!<br>"; }
function myThirdFunction() {
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += "Moused out!<br>"; }
</script>
```

## Event propagation

* Two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM: bubbling and capturing
* If you have a `<p>` element inside a `<div>` element, and the user clicks on the `<p>` element, which element’s “click” event should be handled first?
* Bubbling (default, useCapture=false): the inner most element’s event is handled first and then the outer one
* Capturing (useCapture=true): the outer most element’s event is handled first and then the inner one
* Example
